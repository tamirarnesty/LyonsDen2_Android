<h1>Posting an Announcement</h1>

<p>The Announcement Proposal feature is available to all app users. Before proposing an announcement
you should make sure that you have: a title, a description, as well as a teacher to approve your announcement.</p>

<h3>Announcement Contents</h3>

<p>The title should be kept short. Titles that are too long will not be read properly by the receivers. The description can be as
detailed as you want, but it is recommended to keep it brief. It should not be longer than approximately 200-300 words.</p>

<p>Along with the description and title, you can also provide a custom date-time stamp and an optional location. The date-time stamp
is automaticaly generated from the current date and time and can be changed upon will.

<br>
<br>We do not <i>recommended</i> you change the date-time stamp unless necessary for the content of the announcement.
<br>The date-time stamp determines where on the list of announcements your announcement will show up. A date-time stamp that is far into the
future will ensure that your announcement will stay on top of the list until that date and time has passed. A
date-time stamp into the past will put your announcement lower in the list of announcements.

<br>
<br>We recommend keeping this in mind when you post announcements.</p>

<p>The location field is optional. It is recomended that you use it only if your announcement is
connected to a specific place, such as a room in the school or a place outside of school. This would generally be used for
club meetings, or event locations.

<br>
<br>The location should be brief and to the point.
<br>The shorter the location, the better it is.</p>

<h3>Announcement Approval</h3>

<p>Every announcement proposal must be approved by a teacher before being posted. After you have finished writing
your announcement, you should pass your device with the announcement visible to a registered teacher for review.

<br>
<br>Once the teacher has reviewed and approved the proposal, a submit button will appear and the approve button will be changed
to an unlock button.</p>

<p>After the proposal has been approved it will be locked from editing. If you need to edit the propsal you can press
the Unlock button to unlock the proposal. Keep in mind that you will need to regain your approval if you unlock your proposal.

<br>
<br>So make sure you are satisfied with your announcement before requesting a teacher to review it.</p>

<p>The submit button will post your announcement and close your proposal. If you have a slow internet connection, please allow
for a few extra seconds after the proposal has been closed to make sure that it has been uploaded. You will receive a message once your
announcement has been posted. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that if you press the back button or close the app before the announcement has been submitted,
any content that you have entered as well as your approval will be lost.</p>

<p>After the announcement has been uploaded it will be visible in the announcement list. The announcement list can be found from the side menu
or in Home screen. </p>
