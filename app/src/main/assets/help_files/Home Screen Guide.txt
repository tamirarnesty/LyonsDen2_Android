so long as the school calendar is accurate. You will be able to see day 1 or day 2, respective
of the day. If school is not in session, such as a weekend or PA Day, the number representing day will be
X, for unavailable.

start day, you will find a smaller "Late Start" label right next to the day.

regarding each period has to be manually entered by you. A simple press & hold 
on one of the periods will open a small window where you can edit the content
of the currently selected period.

<br>The timetable automatically highlights the current period and will highlight
the proper periods on Late Start days as well. If you are checking during a 
time that is not a period, a white line will be placed in the approprite spot.

be placed on the right side of the time table.
