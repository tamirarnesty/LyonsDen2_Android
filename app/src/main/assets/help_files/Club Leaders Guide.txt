<h1>Club Leading Duties</h1>

<h3>Becoming a Club Leader</h3>

<p>As a club leader, the first thing you should do, is gain a 'club code' for
your club. You can get your club's code from either Denesh Kumar,
Inal Gotov or Tamir Arnesty.

<br>
<br>This code is specific to each club.
<br>Do not share it with anyone unless they have an executive position in your club.
<br>False leaders will be removed.
<br>

<br>After getting your club code ,the next thing you should do is head into the User
section of the app. This section will have your name as the title and can be found in the side menu.

<br>
<br>You will then have to show the extra buttons at the bottom of the screen
and press the button that says "Become Club Leader". A window will appear and
you can enter the club code of your club. After submitting your code, you will 
see a message on screen saying "Key match Found!". At this point you should be able
to navigate to your club in the Club list and see a club leader's editing bar
at the bottom.

<br>
<br>If you do not see this bar, you do not have access to club leadership or the code you entered is incorrect.
</p>

<h3>Managing your Club</h3>

<p> When you designate yourself as a club leader for your club, the editing toolbar will have two buttons,
which can be found at the bottom of the screen. One of which will be an edit button, which allows you to edit
your clubs title and description. When pressing done, this information will be updated. These new changes should appear in
the Club list and on your current club page.

<br>
<br>In the toolbar you will also see an "Add" button. This button will take you to
the announcement proposal screen, where you can create an announcement to post
in your club. This announcement has to be approved by a teacher as usual and 
will only be posted into your club's feed, not into the global app's feed.
